# Presentation Notes

Damn! Nice presentation

GDP - response

Predictors

Gross fixed capital formation
Household consumption expenditure
stringency index

Agriculture
manufacture
construction

Chose G20 countries (fastest growing economies)

2017 and 2018 are pre-covid

2019 and 2020 are index data

Methods - they used GLMs

Two models - pre-covid and covid model

Gross fixed capital and household consumptison are significant and have positive slopes

What was not that significant??

For COVID:

stringency should affect GDP BUT it is still under 0.5 (false rejection is greater than 5%)

Also has a positive slope

They Checked normality for both models 

don't have such big variations

Have 745 leverage points and not as good homoskedasticity

Impacts on industry sector??

Unemployment rate has negative coefficients

Stringency index is positive in OVID model

## World Economy Presentation 2 with George Chen

OECD ??

Quarterly GDP data, Oxford COVID policy tracer

They had Chinese quarterly data???

They used growth rate as opposed to quarterly GDP

They also used the stringency index

Only time was a relevant predictor for them??

They used multiple regression on the entiredataset?

Decent $R^2$ score.

Maybe COIVD affected GDP directly?
